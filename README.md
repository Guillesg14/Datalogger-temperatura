# Datalogger-temperatura

Hi erveryone, 
this is how i make a dattaloger as my final pryecto for my professional training in electronics.
The maing goal is to log temperatures from a biology incubator, into an SD card and export this file to Excel, so u can monitor the temperature inside the incubator.

As u can see in the photos, the proyect has tho sensors, two switches, one is O/I, and the other for star/pause meditions. also u can check in the screen the time, the max and min temperature inside and the medium.
